#Tuple:-Tuple is a user defined dat type used to store no.of elements with different data types.A tuple is represented by parentesis()
#       > Tuple elements are immutable data types
#       > immutable data type means in data type we can not do perform all these insert,delete,update,,in mutable data type we can do perform all these operations.
#       >In this data,never change in tuple,,,,in list change the data
#       > examples of tuple is...Adhar number,pan number,rice card number etc... stores in tuple.

#    Tuple also having 4 types of operations. They are:-1.Indexing
#                                                       2.Concatenation
#                                                       3.Replication
#                                                       4.Slicing


# 1.)Indexing:-    Indexing is the process to print a specified elements in a tuple.

#ex:- to print list elemts by an indexing method?
#t=(10,20,30,40,50,60)
#print(t[2])
#print(t[3])
#print(t[4])
#print(t[5])
#print(t[0])


# 2.)Concatenation:-Joining of two or more List elements into a single tuple is called concatenation.

#ex:-Write a program to print joining of two or more elements?

#t1=(10,20,30)
#t2=(40,50,60)
#t3=(70,80,90)
#print(t1+t2+t3)

#3.)Replication:- To print the tuple required no.of time is known as replication.
#Ex:-
#t=[10,20,30]
#print(t*3)
#print(t*5)

#4.)Slicing:-  Slicing is the process of printing tuple elements in specific pattern is known as slicing.
#                  [s:e-1]>>>s=star index(0),,,,e=end index-1
#Ex:- Write a program to print slicng the values in the lsi elements?
#t=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90]
#print(l[ :6])
#print(l[4: ])
#print(l[ : ])
#print(l[1:8])
