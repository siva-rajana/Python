#3.CONTROL STATEMENTS :->> The control statements are used to control the flow of the variable execution...
#                       >>  These statements are also called as Decision Making Statements.

#                    The control statements are classified into 2 types. they are...

#                    1.Conditional Statements(if,if-else,if-elif,nested if)
#                    2.Looping Statements(for,while) '''

# 1.)Conditional Statements:-these statements are depend on true and false conditions,,if the condition is true then the code is execute or false not execute.
#                     These statements are classified into 5 types they are given below..
#                           1.If statement
#                           2.If else 
#                           3.If elif 
#                           4.Nested if.


#          1.)If statement:-It is the simplest form of Decision control statements....
#                          >> the syntax of if statement...>> variable declaration
#                                                             if(condition):
#                                                                  print("st-1")
                
#n=int(input("eneter any number"))
#if(n>0):
#    print("the given number is positive")


#          2.)If else statement:- to print the conditions eigther st-1 or st-2 depends on true and false of the given conditions..
#
#                               >> the syntax is>> V.D
#                                                  if(condition):
#                                                      print("st-1")
#                                                  else:
#                                                      print("st-2")



#Q.)Write the program on if statements whether the person is eligible for vote or not?

#age=int(input("eneter the person age:"))
#if(age>=18):

#Q.)write a program to print whether given number   even and odd numbers by if else statement?

#num=int(input("enetr any number:"))
#if(num%2==0):
#    print("The given number is even")
#else:
#    print("the given number is odd")

#Q.)write a program to print largest number in  given numbers?

#num1=int(input("enter any number"))

#Q.)Write a program to print enter any character if character is in lower case then convert it into upper case letter and if it is upper case then it is convert it into upper case?

ch=input("enter any character:")
if(ch>='A' and ch<='Z'):
