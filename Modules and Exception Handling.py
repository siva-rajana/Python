#Module:- > A module is a free defined code used to print or we use whenever required or wherever required.
#         > module is function for a class or an interface.

#         > no.of modules becomes a library.

# Exception:-
#            An Exception is an error which abstract the normal flow of excution of a program.

# Exception Handling:-
#                    Conversion of an error into a readable message is called Exception Handling


#note:- In computer, by performing division operation in arthimatic operations,any number divisible by with zero is result enfinite answer...
# ex:- 0/7=0,0/8=0 but 7/0=............... etc,5/0=enfinite number so it makes computer in slow
# so that by avoiding this problem we use exception handling by giving a simple msg.

#n=int(input("enter any number"))
#d=int(input("enter any number"))                               #>> output:- enter number 10
#try:                                                                        enter number 0
#    print(n/d)                                                              divisible by zero is not possible
